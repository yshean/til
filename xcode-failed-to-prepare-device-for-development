# XCode: Failed to prepare device for development

Possible solutions:
- Quit your XCode, reboot your iOS device (additionally reboot your Mac OS if it doesn't work), connect your device to Mac, launch XCode again
- If you've recently upgraded your iOS device, you might have to upgrade your Mac *and* update your XCode manually to ensure that they are both at the latest version

So far, I have encountered both situations, and the above solutions worked for me.
